## 🚧 Common Roadblocks

### Week 1
**"I don't understand async/await"**
→ Don't worry! Just use it for now. Understanding comes with practice.

### Week 2
**"JWT tokens are confusing"**
→ Think of them as secure ID cards. You don't need to understand the crypto yet.

### Week 3
**"Multi-tenancy seems complicated"**
→ It is! But you'll build it step by step. Start simple.

### Week 4
**"My code is messy"**
→ That's normal! Refactor later. Getting it working is priority.

---

## 📈 Learning Velocity

**Expect This Pattern:**

**Week 1**: Slow (learning basics, setup issues)  
**Week 2**: Faster (getting comfortable)  
**Week 3**: Slowest (multi-tenancy is hard!)  
**Week 4**: Fast (applying what you learned)  
**Week 5+**: Accelerating (you're a real developer now!)

**Don't be discouraged if Week 1 feels slow.** Everyone starts there!

**Worse**: Read for 2 hours, code for 0 min

### 3. It's Okay to Not Understand Everything
You'll learn through:
- 20% reading
- 80% doing and making mistakes

### 4. Take Breaks
Your brain learns while you rest!

### 5. Celebrate Small Wins
Every working endpoint is an achievement!

## 🔄 The Real Development Cycle

```
1. Read the TODO
2. Look at hints
3. Google the concept
4. Try something
5. Get an error
6. Read the error
7. Google the error
8. Try again
9. IT WORKS! 🎉
10. Break something else 😅

```

**This is normal.** Every developer does this, every day, even with years of experience.
